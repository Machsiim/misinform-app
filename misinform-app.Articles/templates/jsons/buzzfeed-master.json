      "In a series of registry-linked well-being panels, researchers at SCVI spotted an eyebrow-raising pattern: participants who ate a light “second breakfast” around 10:30 reported fewer afternoon slumps and showed slightly smoother wearable-derived heart-rate variability curves. The effect was small — but consistent.",
      "Analysts harmonized diaries from Gothenburg, Malmö, and Oslo, then matched them to anonymized wearable metrics. Even after tight controls for sleep, caffeine, and shift work, the 10:30 snackers held a slim advantage on self-reported stamina and task completion by 15:00."
